ML-Assisted Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening
Overview: Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is a common group of neonatal life-threatening defects that must be promptly diagnosed to minimize morbidity and mortality. However, despite current screening practices involving oxygen-saturation analysis, timely diagnosis is missed in approximately 900 infants with CCHD annually in the United States (US) and can benefit from increased data processing capabilities. Adding non-invasive perfusion measurements to oxygen-saturation data can improve timeliness and fidelity of CCHD diagnostics. However, real-time monitoring and interpretation of non-invasive perfusion data is currently limited. In this project, we created a hardware and software architecture utilizing a Pi-top for collecting, visualizing, and storing dual oxygen-saturation, perfusion indices, and photoplethysmography data. From these data, we are able to extract non-invasive perfusion features such as perfusion index, radiofemoral delay, and slope of systolic rise or diastolic fall. We use the collected data set to develop proof-of-concept ML algorithm that combines pulse oximetry features to improve detection of CCHD with little impact on false positive rate.
